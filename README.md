# YT-Bot
This is for help with the bot on my youtube channel.
Please comment on video if you need help with it. Also if there are any errors please report.
My channel link is https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFl9SyAccKzkAXkbUv6YsLw.
For this you do need npm and node js https://nodejs.org/en/.
You also need nodemon command is npm install -g nodemon
I also recommend atom which is a text editor for programmers. 
Also install discordie from github not npm and rename it to discordie in the node_modules folder or copy my node_modules folder.
Add discord bot https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me.
Add bot to server https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID_GOES_HERE&scope=bot&permissions=0.
